# Implement a design from scratch
HTML, CSS Responsive design;
In this project, I will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

# Project Objective:
 To have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

# Requirements
you are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
you are not to use Javascript

# Interactions note:
The web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
links hover/active: #FF6565
button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page
